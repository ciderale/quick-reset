# quick-reset

This clojure library embraces the ideas  of
[Stuart Sierra's clojure development workflow, reloaded][blog].

This library bundles the re-occurring workflow logic and tries to 
gracefully handle compilation errors in required namespaces. 
In particular, the `(reset)` functionality is not lost
upon failed refreshes. Moreover, the REPL also starts despite compilation
errors in referenced namespaces. Both problems were described in the
original post and required an annoying restart of the REPL.
This library is robust against these errors and leaves the REPL in 
a sane state.

[Please refer to the original blog post for a detailed description of
the workflow][blog].    
A quick summary and the necessary configuration
steps are described below.

## Usage at the REPL

This library allows for rapid development cycles with up-to-date
sources.    
A single command is enough to refresh all modified namespaces
and to creates a brand new, started application.   

```clojure
user=> (reset)   ; whenever you want a fresh system
```
This stops your current application, refreshes all modified namespaces,
creates a fresh instance of your application, and starts it.

## Setup


The latest version is 
```clojure
[ciderale/quick-reset "0.5.0"]
```

#### Add dependency in your Leiningen `project.clj`

```clojure
{ ;; your project configuration
 :profiles {:dev {:source-paths ["dev"] ; or wherever you put your `user.clj`
                  :dependencies  [[ciderale/quick-reset "0.5.0"]]}}}
```
This assumes that your `user.clj` resides in the `dev/` folder within 
your project.


#### Create an application constructor in `your/namespace.clj` of choice

This library requires a constructor function to initialize a fresh
application.    
Note that this function is called for each invocation of
(reset), after successfully reloading the namespaces.

The following pseudo code illustrates a simple constructor:  

```clojure
   (defn your-constructor [] 
     {:port 300
      :start (fn [x] 
               (assoc x :server (run-server (:port x)))
      :stop  (fn [x] 
               (stop-server (:server x)) 
               (dissoc x :server)))})
```

The constructor must returns a map representing the initial
application configuration.  `quick-reset` requires this map to contain
:start and :stop fields.  These fields keep functions that take the
current state, manipulate that state, and return the new state. 

This configuration is essentially the only global variable in your
system. All your sub systems should (indirectly) refer to this
configuration. Note that using other global variables (e.g. via `def`)
will potentially lead to an incomplete system refresh. You have been
warned..

#### Prepare your REPL with code in your `user.clj`
```clojure
(ns user 
  (:use [quick-reset.core :only [set-constructor reset]]))
 
  (set-constructor 'your.namespace/your-constructor)
```


## Technical Notes

Inversion of control (IoC) allows that this library has no
dependencies on a concrete system.  The only reference to concrete
systems is injected via the `constructor` as detailed above.
Consequently, changes in your source files and a subsequent namespace
refresh do not affect the `quick-reset` namespace.  This is why
`(reset)` will remain accessible even if the refresh of certain
namespaces fails. This makes the refreshes robust against compilation
errors.

The second problem is that erroneous namespaces hindered the REPL from
starting. This is addressed by loading the constructor function's
namespace (and all its dependencies) in a separate thread. A failure
thus no longer jeopardizes the startup process of the REPL.
